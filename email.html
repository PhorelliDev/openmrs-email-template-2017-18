    You are the reason why projects like OpenMRS exist.
    Open-source needs people (like you!) that are willing to contribute their time and efforts towards open-source software for good causes. Whether you have coded, created artwork, written blog posts, designed web pages, or stuck around helping other people on the chat services - you have helped OpenMRS to grow a lot!
    Here at OpenMRS, we value open-source contributions very much.
    Open-source is the principle that anyone can freely remix, edit, or improve technology - the basis of a free and open web.
    We appreciate that you believe in this with us, and that you've taken the steps to support technologies, such as OpenMRS, on an open web. The journey doesn't stop here though.
    You can continue to put your open-source skills to work towards OpenMRS, or other open-source projects! The team here at OpenMRS wish you happy future endeavours in open-source, and we hope to see you next GCI!<br>
